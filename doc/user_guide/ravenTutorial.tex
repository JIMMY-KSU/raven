\subsection{Overview}
\label{sub:overview}
RAVEN is a multi-purpose software framework designed to perform parametric and stochastic analysis based on the
response of complex system codes. The initial development was designed to provide dynamic probabilistic risk
analysis capabilities (DPRA) to the thermal-hydraulic code RELAP-7, currently under development at Idaho National
Laboratory (INL).
Now, RAVEN is not only a framework to perform DPRA but it is a multi-purpose stochastic and uncertainty 
quantification platform, capable of communicating with any system code through the provided  Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs). These APIs allow RAVEN to interact with any code as long as all the parameters
that need to be perturbed are accessible through input files or via  \texttt{Python} interfaces. RAVEN is capable
of investigating the system response as well as the input space using sampling schemes, such as Monte Carlo, Grid,
Latin Hyper Cube. However, RAVEN strength is the set of system feature discovery capabilities.
