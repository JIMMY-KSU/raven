\subsection{Overview}
\label{sub:overview}
RAVEN is a multi-purpose software framework designed to perform parametric and stochastic analysis based on the
response of complex system codes. The initial development was designed to provide dynamic probabilistic risk
analysis capabilities (DPRA) to the thermal-hydraulic code RELAP-7, currently under development at Idaho National
Laboratory (INL).
Now, RAVEN is not only a framework to perform DPRA but it is a multi-purpose stochastic and uncertainty 
quantification platform, capable of communicating with any system code through the provided  Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs) as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:modelAPIs}. These APIs allow RAVEN to interact with any code as long as all the parameters
that need to be perturbed are accessible through input files or via  \texttt{Python} interfaces. RAVEN is capable
of investigating the system response as well as the input space using sampling schemes, such as Monte Carlo, Grid,
Latin Hyper Cube. However, RAVEN strength is the set of system feature discovery capabilities.

\subsubsection{Acquiring and Installing RAVEN}
RAVEN is supported on three separate computing platforms: Linux, OSX (Apple Macintosh), and Microsoft Windows.
Currently, RAVEN is open-source and downloadable from RAVEN GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/idaholab/raven}.
New users should visit \url{https://github.com/idaholab/raven/wiki} or refer to the user manual ~\cite{RAVENuserManual}
to get started with RAVEN. This typically involves the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Download RAVEN}
    \\ You can download the source code of RAVEN from \url{https://github.com/idaholab/raven}.
  \item \textit{Install RAVEN dependencies}
    \\ Instructions are available from \url{https://github.com/idaholab/raven/wiki}, or the user manual ~\cite{RAVENuserManual}.
  \item \textit{Install RAVEN}
    \\ Instructions are available from \url{https://github.com/idaholab/raven/wiki}, or the user manual ~\cite{RAVENuserManual}.
  \item \textit{Run RAVEN}
    \\ If RAVEN is installed successfully, please run the regression tests to verify your installation:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
      ./run_tests
    \end{lstlisting}
    Normally there are skipped tests because either some of the codes are not available, or some of the test are not
    currently working. The output will explain why each is skipped. If all the tests pass, you are ready to run RAVEN.
    Now, open a terminal and use the following command (replace \texttt{<inputFileName.xml>} with your
    RAVEN input file):
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
      raven_framework <inputFileName.xml>
    \end{lstlisting}
    where the \texttt{raven\_framework} script can be found in the RAVEN folder. Alternatively, the \texttt{Driver.py} script
    contained in the folder ``\texttt{raven/framework}'' can be directly used:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
      python raven/framework/Driver.py <inputFileName.xml>
    \end{lstlisting}
  \item \textit{Participate in RAVEN user communities}
    \\ Join RAVEN mail lists to get help and updates of RAVEN: \url{https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/inl-raven-users}.
\end{itemize}
